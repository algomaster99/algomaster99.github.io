> A personal website showcasing the work and profile of Aman Sharma.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a personal website for Aman Sharma, a researcher with interests spanning software engineering and other fields. It aims to provide a centralized location for information about his publications, posters, services (PhD activities), and talks. The website is built using Zola, a static site generator, and is designed to be easily maintainable and deployable. The value proposition is to present a professional online presence that highlights Aman Sharma's expertise and accomplishments.

## Key Features

*   **Publications Showcase:** A dedicated section to list and display publications.
*   **Poster Gallery:** Showcase of research posters presented at conferences or events.
*   **Service Overview:** Details on PhD activities and contributions.
*   **Talks Archive:** A collection of presented talks and presentations.
*   **Clean and Responsive Design:** A user-friendly and accessible design that adapts to different screen sizes.
*   **Easy to Customize:** Configuration options to easily modify the website's appearance and content.
*   **Static Site Generation:**  Fast loading times and enhanced security.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you need to have the following tools installed:

*   **Zola:** (version >= 0.16) - Static site generator.  Install from [Zola website](https://www.getzola.org/).
*   **Web browser:** (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge) - For viewing the website.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    bash
    zola build
    
    +++
    title = "Example Poster"
    image = "/posters/example-poster.jpg"
    +++

    A brief description of the poster.
    *   **Talks:**  Create Markdown files in `content/talks` with information about your talks, including the title, date, location, and a link to the slides or recording (if available).

### Customizing the Theme

The website uses the "shadharon" Zola theme.  You can customize the theme by:

*   **Overriding Stylesheets:** Create an `override.css` file in the `static` directory to add custom CSS styles. This file is already linked in the `config.toml`.
*   **Modifying Templates:**  Copy template files from the theme's directory (`themes/shadharon/templates`) to your project's `templates` directory to override them.

## API Documentation

> This section is not directly applicable to a static website generated by Zola.  However, if you were to add dynamic functionality using JavaScript and an external API, you would document the API endpoints and data formats here.
>
> For example, if you were fetching data from a REST API, you would document each endpoint, including:
>
> *   **Endpoint URL:**
> *   **Method:** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
> *   **Parameters:** (including data type and description)
> *   **Request Body:** (if applicable, with JSON schema)
> *   **Response Body:** (with JSON schema and example)
> *   **Example Usage:** (with code snippets in JavaScript)

## Troubleshooting

*   **"Error: theme `shadharon` not found"**: Make sure the `shadharon` theme is correctly installed and located in the `themes` directory.  You might need to download the theme separately if it's not included in the repository.  Double-check the `theme = "shadharon"` line in your `config.toml`.
*   **Website not updating after changes**:  Make sure you are rebuilding the site with `zola build` after making changes to the configuration, content, or templates.  If you're running `zola serve`, it should automatically detect changes and rebuild, but sometimes you might need to refresh the browser manually.
*   **Images not loading**: Verify that the image paths in your Markdown files are correct and that the images are located in the correct directories within the `static` folder.

## Performance Considerations

*   **Optimize Images:**  Use optimized images to reduce page loading times. Tools like ImageOptim or TinyPNG can help compress images without significant loss of quality.
*   **Minimize CSS and JavaScript:**  Minify your CSS and JavaScript files to reduce their size. Zola can automatically compile Sass to CSS, but further minification might be necessary for optimal performance.
*   **Leverage Browser Caching:** Configure your web server to properly cache static assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## Security Notes

*   As a static website, this project is generally less vulnerable to security threats than dynamic websites.
*   However, it's still important to keep your dependencies (Zola and any other tools you use) up to date to patch any security vulnerabilities.
*   If you add any dynamic functionality with JavaScript, be sure to follow secure coding practices to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other vulnerabilities.
*   **Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.) to the repository.**
